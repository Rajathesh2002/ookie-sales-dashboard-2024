# 📊 COOKIE SALES DASHBOARD – 2024

This project demonstrates how to transform messy cookie sales data into a structured Excel dashboard with clear monthly insights using **line chart visualizations**. The task involved **data cleaning**, formatting, structuring, and creating an interactive dashboard—all done using Microsoft Excel (without Power BI).

## 🗃️ RAW DATA

The raw data provided was unorganized and required cleaning. It included inconsistent entries and column misalignments. Each product’s sales were spread across 12 months.
